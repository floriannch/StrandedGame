## About The Game

Stranded is a classic text-based adventure game set on a deserted spacecraft. You awaken to find the ship silent and adrift in space, orbiting an unknown planet. Your mission is to explore the ship, uncover what happened, and find the necessary components to repair the critical systems before it's too late.

This game is built in Java and is based on the popular "World of Zuul" educational project. It features a simple command-based interface, a multi-room spacecraft to explore, and a variety of items to interact with.

## Features

*   **Explore a Mysterious Spacecraft:** Navigate through multiple decks and rooms, from the control room to the engine bay.
*   **Solve Puzzles:** Find and use key items to repair the ship's systems.
*   **Uncover the Story:** Piece together what happened to the crew.
*   **Classic Text-Adventure Gameplay:** A retro experience driven by your imagination.
*   **Extensible Codebase:** Built on a solid foundation that's easy to modify and expand.

## Tech Stack

*   **Java:** The core programming language for the game logic.
*   **BlueJ:** The IDE used for development.
